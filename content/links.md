## Social Media

###<span class="logo_icon" markdown=1>![Mastodon logo](%assets_url%/mastodon_logo.png)</span>Mastodon

* **[@jsstaedtler@mastodon.art](https://mastodon.art/@jsstaedtler)**

This is where I'm most active, and where all new works are shared first.  You can follow me there from most Fediverse platforms (Misskey, Firefish, Pixelfed, etc.)

You can also follow my Mastodon account via **RSS feed**:

* **All posts and topics**: https://mastodon.art/@jsstaedtler.rss
* **All-ages art posts**: https://mastodon.art/tags/jssart.rss
* **Adult-only art posts**: https://mastodon.art/tags/jsslewd.rss

Mastodon is a microblogging platform with no ads or algorithms, operated by individuals instead of corporations.  If you're interested in joining, I recommend visiting [fedi.garden](https://fedi.garden) to find an instance that serves your interests and values.


###<span class="logo_icon" markdown=1>![Tumblr logo](%assets_url%/tumblr_logo.png)</span>Tumblr

* **[jsstaedtler](https://www.tumblr.com/jsstaedtler)**

I'm not as active there, but I follow and reblog other artists.

Artistry isn't my day job, but it does involve a lot of time and labour.  If you particularly enjoy what I'm creating, I would greatly appreciate any amount of support!
