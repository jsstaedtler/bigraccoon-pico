I'm not particularly into writing, but I definitely "microblog."  I'd been a Twitter user since back when it was for SMS texting, and I was an avid user of Google+ for the life of that service.  And today, on Mastodon, I continue to communicate in chunks of 500 characters or less.

Those media are ephemeral by nature, but every once in a while I have a lot more to say, or a need to fully document something.  So here I'm carving out a space for that kind of content, where it can live for much longer.
