title: I Played Xenoblade Chronicles 3 - Chapter 2

byline: This was originally written as a long thread on Twitter—that's why it's organized in chunks of up to 280 characters and 4 images.  I've stitched them all together into a single article here.

### Spoiler Alert

Obviously, this article contains spoilers for Chapters 2 and earlier of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__, so you may want to play through those before proceeding.

It also makes the occasional reference back to the first __Xenoblade Chronicles__, its sequel __Xenoblade Chronicles 2__, and the DLC expansions for each: __Future Connected__ and __Torna - The Golden Country__.  Those will add new context to __XC3__, but could be considered minor spoilers for those games.

*Additionally*, I've added a few new entries which contain spoilers for *the entirety of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__* (including DLC expansion __Future Redeemed__).  *But those will be hidden by default.*  Click here if you would like to view those as well:

So there's a whole bunch of these Moebius muppets.  We've seen one of them earlier in Chapter 1, in a Colony 9 homecoming flashback.  They all have single letter names, and I'm wondering if they're abbreviations.

> The monster from the end of Chapter 1 walked in here, then reverted to Consul form, obviously to make it clear that they have this transformational ability.  But after reverting, J is seen right behind D.  Playing through for the first time, I didn't even realize J was there because all of this is new and confusing, and it's so subtle that it doesn't spoil the big surprise in Chapter 4.  But after coming back from a full playthrough, you can't say the devs didn't put the hints out there.

Ethel saved our Colony 9ers in some unspecified disaster (in which poor Joran apparently died, which still eats at Lanz).

I guess she was born a badass?  She couldn't be much older than our heroes back then, but she's already well known among the colonies.

> Yeah, she was just born a badass.  Presumably in her original life, she would have been trained to be a fierce soldier by the age of 10.

----

So we're headed for The City, which is at the big honking sword.  Which of course is the Mechonis' Sword of __XC1__.  Galahad Fortress was at the hilt, but the sword stands point-down, so a different city must exist near the ground (or there's some climbing to do).

> LOL.  Turns out there's just a really long elevator ride

----

Oh, and the game's cover art made it look like the sword had pierced the Urayan titan of __XC2__, but that's not the case!  From Millick Meadows we can see they're actually a good distance apart.

----

Also, the bottom of the sword is surrounded by swirling clouds.  I'm getting some World Tree vibes from __XC2__, but it also prevents us from gleaning any info of what sea level looks like.

> Jeez, I was wrong about it *again* here—the dang sword is *behind* the ocean vortex.  Still, these views were 100% arranged by the devs to maximize the mystery while slowly revealing the geography as the story progresses.

----

LOL, the two knuckleheads are hitting it off already.

The campsites in __XC3__ clearly replace the inns of __XC2__ (where you could pay for the privilege of claiming your bonus EXP, or pay even more to change the tides).  At least here they're free to use.

But the campsites concept isn't new: it was used in the __XC2__ expansion, __Torna: The Golden Country__, since that wasn't full of cities like __XC2__ was.  And those campsites also served as a place for characters to do crafting.

> Here's yet another instance of something just popping up that, to us players, is monumentally suspicious...  but which ends up being dropped and left unanswered.  Another example was the all-gender bathhouse in Chapter 1: like, okay, I guess these teenagers are used to seeing everyone naked like it's no big deal 🤨

> But it's all consistent with the whole point of this world: these kid soldiers are so narrowly focused on war and combat in their absurdly short lives that there is no room for *anything* else.  Not for idle curiosity, not for comparing biological differences, and not even for relationships or sex.

> Our protagonists specifically act like irrational buffoons sometimes because they've literally been denied time and freedom to develop like normal human beings.

----

Something I just figured out are these age marks on all the characters.  They start out completely red, and turn to grey over 10 years.  Ethel's is on her chest, so we can tell she was indeed OP at a very young age.

The Consul is in on the Iris system as well, and is just as stymied by the fog as everyone else.  Wondering if Vandham used it intentionally somehow during his operation last chapter, or else chose a location with lots of it.

You'll never convince me that queen is Melia (or that Agnus' queen is Nia).  That's just too simple.  But it's worth noting her mask is indeed similar to what Melia wore in __XC1__.

This game does a lot of forceful hand-holding, which honestly works out for the best.  I forget how __XC1__ handled it, but __XC2__ infodumped on you from time to time but didn't stop to care if you actually understood.

Well this is neat, and it looks like it ties in to party skills.  This is a direct replacement for blades' field skills in __XC2__, where there were some 2 dozen different skill types you would foster among all your blades.  It wasn't bad, but it wouldn't work here.

Another holdover from __XC2__: some quests accept a whole bunch of different items, but some items are worth more to the quest than others.  Here it actually shows you each item's score as you discover them.

EXCUSE ME, THAT IS A HAND OF THE MECHONIS

I can't tell which hand, though.  One of them fell before the events of __XC1__, the other fell during them.

Sadly you can't reach the fingers from here, at least not at this point of the game.

> This was so damn awesome.  It's absolutely the first fallen hand, where the Machina had established their secret village.  The undeniable evidence comes later when you can climb to the topmost lookout just like you could in __XC1__; but also, when you reach Elaice Highway behind the hand, the background music is literally that of the Machina village.

A cute new feature is that monsters will sometimes behave unusually, and a red exclamation mark will draw your attention to them.  This hox was running around and digging up items that I could collect.  They're normally aggressive but this one didn't notice me.

I really wonder if he means this literally.  I could never tell just how biological Machina really are.  The ones in __XC1__ claimed to have to "shut down" on a schedule (though they may have been pulling my chain).

Well this is concerning, apparently there are random energy events that just annihilate a sphere of matter wherever.  Bizarrely, any remaining solid matter acts as if it's still attached.

> It seems the reason the remaining geography doesn't collapse is because the world is frozen in time by Z.  It's also possible that much of the world is illusory (as opposed to being the literal matter from either of the original two worlds).

> But there's an apparent inconsistency, because anyone can move rocks around or dig out massive mines.  So it's really hard to understand what kinds of forces actually act on the constituent mass of Aionios.  If matter that can't move through time is not affected by gravity, why can it be moved by any other kind of force?

> This continues to be a mystery to me...

----

And that's what caused the giant gash in the side of Uraya's titan.  It seems two energy types collided and annihilated everything around them.  Is this ether from two different universes?  It doesn't look like the life force we've seen so far.

Manana's cooking replaces the pouch items from __XC2__ (which I always found overwhelming, whenever I didn't simply forget about them).  Here you can cook something up at a camp, and all characters get its effects for a certain time.

Riku eventually does show us gem crafting, which is totally different from __XC1__ (which I don't miss at all).  Basically unlocking perks that you can assign to any characters, like a second set of accessory slots.  Kinda redundant, but more accessories is welcome.

I've finally been granted the use of chain attacks, though it's very different from how previous versions worked.  It has a lot to do with each character's class working in a certain order, but all I know is I can't pull off a break-topple-etc. combo at all 😩

Mio's finally doing us a favour and trying to extract info on Noah's Pyronado, but he's frustratingly coy about it.  It seems people can naturally summon a particular weapon, but back in term 1 Noah was embarrassed by his, so he initially pretended he couldn't.

> WHY DOES IT GLOW, *INDEED*

> It's amazing how much incidental stuff gets totally flipped on its head after experiencing __Future Redeemed__.  Noah's Blade normally has a blue glow, but in various circumstances it will change to green.  I've seen others' analysis of how the glow changes during various cutscenes, which all boils down to what sets off the Pneuma core.  It's clear now that the true power behind Ouroboros was known by the developers while they produced the base game (as opposed to something tacked on after the fact).

----

Riku was sympathetic, and provided young Noah with physical weapons, even going as far as offering him this behemoth... until learning Noah was faking it all along.  Still, he insisted Noah take it.

----

Something about this flashback is nagging at me: how far back is this history that Riku's talking about?  Certainly the people of Aionios must have stories or mythology of the past, but could that be messed up by the fact that people only live for 10 years?

----

Generational turnover must be absurd, and such stories would be passed on like a game of telephone—facts could be mangled over a very short time.  So Riku could be talking about something from merely a few decades ago, and perhaps something really quite mundane.

----

There's also the greater issue of how this society is even sustainable when the average age is less than 5 years old.  How is any information passed on to newer generations?  How is all this technology built and maintained without years of individual education?

----

There are a few possible answers... for one, people may be born with this knowledge.  Perhaps Nopon are long-lived and manage the highly-specialized tasks.  Or perhaps this is all propped up by outside forces (eg. Moebius).

----

But there's the possibility that Nopon don't have the same lifespan issue that the humanoid folk have.  There are Nopon aligned with both Keves and Agnus, and also some who live independently.  Perhaps they're not produced like the soldiers are.

> Well, much of this is made clearer by the end of the game, and even more is answered quite blatantly in __Future Redeemed__.  But even just as the story progresses, you start getting evidence (especially in the Affinity Chart) that Nopon can live *very* long lives.

----

Just... gotta stick that segue in there

Well, this confirms that other people see the Ouroboros crew as weird dark fog monsters.  I wonder if this kind of creature is a real thing in Aionios that people are familiar with, or something new designed to frighten everyone.

It looks like the fog caused Ethel's Iris to go haywire, causing her a great deal of pain.  And subsequently the Consul could no longer see through her.  Once again wondering if this is random chance, or if the fog was unleashed intentionally by someone.

Not only can he steal life force from the flame clock, but he can pull it right out of the living soldiers.  Regular people need to use a blade to do that.  For some reason Moebius has Aionians kill each other rather than just doing the work themselves.

> Heck, is that actually the Pneuma core *visible* inside the gauntlet??

> Something weird about Blades is that they are pre-existing physical objects which anyone can summon out of who-the-heck-knows-where.  Their nature is vague enough to just fit the needs of the game's whole Class system, but it's pointed out in __Future Redeemed__ that this gauntlet was handed down by Ghondor (son of N) to Matthew, and so it would later somehow come into Noah's possession.  If anything, it's kinda weird that Noah only has the one instead of a pair, but there *is* just one Pneuma core, so it's more efficient this way, I dunno

> I certainly don't understand how this ties in to the Sword of the End business, or why N has a purple version of Noah's Blade with his own Lucky 7 inside.  There's some major timeline weirdness that I really can't grasp.

Well that worked.  Since Ethel and her soldiers revived shortly after this, it seems the life force can go back in the other direction as well.

Another old person, like Vandham.  Human like him as well?  I'm not seeing any obvious "racial" features (eg. cat ears, head wings, etc.).

I get the same vibes from his suit as I do from Noah's Pyronado arm.

And to be fair, the only other faces of Moebius we get to see are C, D, J, K, N, and S (A doesn't count); that leaves 15 masked Consuls who could be anything (given sufficient helmet size... like, maybe U could be High Entia).

> There is a single other exception to all of this, which is Na'el.  She is very Gormotti, to the point that it's hard to believe she's 3 generations descended from Noah and Mio (assuming the inter-breeding of Citizens causes special traits to recede).  I'd easily believe she was adopted by Ghondor or Matthew's parents, except that she has a bloodied core crystal—in fact, that alone may cause the Gormotti traits to remain dominant (*because Nia, that's why*)

And so continues the tradition from __XC2__ of uncomfortably detailed creepy old guys.

I don't know if this is a stretch, but... this is the closest thing we've seen to an Aegis core (or the Conduit, or "Zohar") in this game so far.  All the Moebius guys have one on their suit, and it normally glows purple in the centre.

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

> This is likely due to their association with Origin, which in turn is driven by the Trinity Processors, modelled after the Conduit.

> And purple is simply the thematic colour for Moebius, like blue is for Keves, and yellow for Agnus (and in rare cases like Consul H's colony, green symbolizes Keves and Agnus combined).

> Incidentally, purple is the colour of the Aegis core for Ontos (Malos), and green for Pneuma (Pyra/Mythra).  __Future Redeemed__ makes it clear that the green energy glow of Matthew's and Noah's blades is caused by Pneuma, and the purple of N's is by Ontos.

> These common colour themes could be evidence of some connections, except that the original Noah (before N) possessed the purple blade, implying that Moebius did not have a specific connection to Ontos.

----

The Aegises in __XC2__ were actually supercomputer processors from Klaus/Zanza's Conduit research (and it can be argued Alvis from __XC1__ was one as well).  The Aegises were notably egotistical and acted like they were above everyone else.

Same Moebius consuls on both sides, subordinate only to the queens.  So what are the chances the queens aren't in on this as well?

Keves' Castle strongly resembles the High Entia capital, Alcamoth, and the queen looks very much like Melia (who was queen by the end of __XC1__).  It's like Keves took their design cues from a specific time and place on the Bionis.

> I think Melia explained toward the end of the game that Keves Castle literally *is* Alcamoth?  If I'm remembering that right, it's evidence that (at least some of) Aionios is made of the *actual parts* of the two game worlds.

> I had always assumed that was the case, that Z stopped time just as everything started to collide, resulting in a random jumble of geography.  But the timeline gets *extremely* tight if that's the case: Z had to have acted before everything completely annihilated, but did the two halves of Origin need to combine first?  How the heck did *that* work

----

And yet again Agnus is similar, but *not quite*.  The queen resembles Nia, but aside from the voice it could be any Gormotti woman.  The castle doesn't even look Gormotti—if anything it's Tornan in style.  It's like disparate __XC2__ elements were mashed together.

It's important to note how the queens are masked, so we can't tell if they're aged like Vandham and members of Moebius.  Though on the other hand, queens could be swapped out and no one would ever know it.  They may just be puppets propped up by the consuls.

----

That's the end of Chapter 2.

But one more thing, which I didn't pick up on earlier: the Dannagh Desert area here shares the exact same name as a landmark in Torna (from the __XC2__ expansion).  Torna was destroyed 500 years prior to the events of the main __XC2__ game.

Torna's dead titan sank below the Cloud Sea, laying to rest among the ruins of Earth's 21st century civilization (referred to as the Land of Morytha).  It's hard to imagine how this new Dannagh Desert can be at all related to that old one.

----

But interestingly, the music in the area in __XC3__ is just as slow and mournful as the music from the Land of Morytha.

----

Oh hey, gonna tack this on here since I just noticed it: I went back to the prologue, where Noah, Eunie, and Lanz were kids running around in a city.  First off, Lanz had no age mark.  So it certainly seems the trio were reincarnated as soldiers in Aionios.

And secondly: check out Alcamoth in the background.  This city must be on the Bionis' shoulder in Zanza's world—still floating after the fall of Zanza.  And it was there, in the __XC1__ expansion __Future Connected__, that a spacial rift mysteriously opened.
