This was originally written as a long thread on Twitter—that's why it's organized in chunks of up to 280 characters and 4 images.  I've stitched them all together into a single article here.

<div class="box" markdown=1>

### Spoiler Alert

Obviously, this article contains spoilers for Chapters 4 and earlier of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__, so you may want to play through those before proceeding.

It also makes the occasional reference back to the first __Xenoblade Chronicles__, its sequel __Xenoblade Chronicles 2__, and the DLC expansions for each: __Future Connected__ and __Torna - The Golden Country__.  Those will add new context to __XC3__, but could be considered minor spoilers for those games.

*Additionally*, I've added a few new entries which contain spoilers for *the entirety of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__* (including DLC expansion __Future Redeemed__).  *But those will be hidden by default.*  Click here if you would like to view those as well:

No idea how long this chapter will be. 🙃  I need to omit a bunch of side stuff, and maybe focus less on the story details... but on the plus side, the game is starting to enter some interesting philosophical territory, and I want to consider that more closely.

----

XC1's major plot was about a god wielding control over their creation, and that creation wresting control of their lives away from the god.

XC2 had a similar setup, but focused more on a nihilist wanting to punish a creator by destroying their creation.

----

XC3, like the others, features everyday folk who are unaware of their origins, but a select few start to learn the truth, and eventually figure out what to do about it.  But we aren't at the truth part of it yet, and—being Xenoblade—it'll misdirect us first.

----

Noah's and Mio's teams were given a power by someone with a specific, unknown motivation, and the party is moving along to the City as directed.  But we still know nothing about Vandham's organization, or its relationship to Keves, Agnus, or Moebius.

----

The status quo of Aionios needs to end, but maybe Vandham's motivation for change shouldn't be trusted so quickly?

Noah's been asking the right question: *why*.  He's not content to just end the current power structure, but he wants to know what it was for.

----

He's not driven by revenge like Shulk, or by dutiful altruism like Rex.  In fact, part of it is atonement: Noah was part of the machine that he's now working toward bringing down.  And will the lengths he needs to go be just as bad as what he used to do?

----

But enough of that heady stuff; people are killing each other on a battlefield again.  A Kevesi colony is fighting against Cammuravi's Colony Delta, and they're wiping the floor with the Agnians while Cammuravi just stands there in his Ferronis.

> Well, not *that* one, specifically.  But in retrospect, this is establishing the nature of smaller Ferronises as personal fighting mecha (before we take on two of 'em later this chapter).  This also gives more context to the flashback of Ethel defeating Cammuravi in Chapter 2.

----

Watching it approach from the point-of-view of the Keves colony was awesome.  But ultimately, Cammuravi seems like kind of an egotistical jerk.

> I'm forced to assume the battle we just watched was quite a bit in the past.  'Cause why is Cammuravi in a prison cell now?  It must be a result of his loss to Ethel, which was probably less than a year ago (judging by how Colony 4 is still adapting to Dirt rank).

----

Hey, something just came to mind and this is as good a time as any: something XC3 is missing, compared to the previous games, is Heart-to-Hearts!  There were various locations where a discussion could start up between a pair of characters.

----

They were kind of a collectable challenge, but you got to see how the characters felt about specific others.  In XC3, the closest thing is the discussion topics at camp sites; in fact, the campsite marker is a HtH icon (which I never realized is heart-shaped??)

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

----

Something else missing in XC3: button challenges!  Or QTEs, or whatever they're called, which doesn't matter because I hated them and now they're gone!  XC1 had them pop up sometimes during combat, but XC2 went overboard with them.

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1561455801243426817-FatnxoIXEAMr6TX.jpg)

----

The XC2 expansion actually included a new option to disable the QTEs, and when I finally did, my stress went down a great deal.  However, you still had to do them for salvaging, which wasn't as bad since each salvage spot had a fixed combo you could learn.

----

Welp, back to our heroes: after that dramatic detour out of Uraya, they're at the bottom of the Great Cotte Falls, and they need to continue their trek to the Sword.

At least Taion seems back to his normal self again.

There's a hero quest to gain Isurd, which involves putting down some malfunctioning Auto-Levs (like the thing that attacked us at the Colony 18 wreckage).  These are a uniquely Agnian technology that gets brought up from time to time.

(Yes, we remember, Isurd)

After doing whatever quests were available here at Lambda, I checked out the other colonies to see what was available.

There's an overarching theme to all the colonies we've liberated: what the heck do they do now?

----

The people won't be starved of life force if their flame clock were to run out, so they don't need to go out and kill opponents to take theirs.  Though on the other hand, they're all dead to their Castles so they're never getting any more support or supplies.

----

Colony Lambda still has their entire contingent and isn't hurting for supplies just yet, so they're focusing on exploiting the nearby ether mines.

Gamma is in a similarly safe position, but they're working on training their corps of mostly rookies.

----

Colony 30 considers their new situation a gift: they were never much for fighting anyway, and now they're free to futz around full-time on building crazy Levnis shit.

But it's not so rosy for the other free colonies:

----

4 is accustomed to dirt rank, and they're subsisting as well as they can, keeping themselves occupied with the harsh locale while their commander deals with the Castle.

But Colony 9 is nearly coming apart at the seams, under threat of famine and infighting.

XC2 had an absurd animation for an enemy that had been "launched," and it's here in XC3 as well!  Realism is often sacrificed for distinct visual clarity in combat.  ...And it *was* satisfying to beat on that schlub Fox while he was spinning wildly in the air.

There was another issue about the discovery of some weird military gear, but the soldiers here are building petty rivalries instead of collaborating.  The sudden paradigm change has hit them all pretty hard.

But colony dysfunction aside... this military equipment is a BIG DEAL.  It's the same stuff Vandham's crew was using.  Was another member operating out here (near where we met Gray)?

AUGH AND WHAT'S THIS KEYCARD FOR??  This one's going to eat at me for a while.

----

I can't help but think Gray is connected.  He suspiciously has the same nose and a voice a bit reminiscent of Vandham.

He also has a unique insignia on his Chain Attack profile, but it's not the same as what Vandham wore, so no real proof of a connection yet.

> When you complete Gray's ascension quest, he takes off his mask, and you will find that his nose is not shaped nearly as large as it seemed.  And he has no relation to the Vandhams (whose insignia is what was on Guernica's eyepatch).

Not related: Gray always heads to the canteen when visiting a colony.  It's strictly for security purposes, I'm *sure*.  (Then he eats food through his mask)

Done with Colony 9 for now.  Since I'm level 40-something at this point, I was able to take out a few more Colony Iota folk.  It sounds like, for each one I dispatch ahead of time, there will be less resistance if we show up at Iota in person.

This is an interesting quest that gives a bit more insight into off-seeing.  Agnus off-seers normally operate in pairs, but it often seems that one of them takes charge and the other follows their lead.  Schoon was a follower until her partner died.

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

</div>

----

So it seems off-seeing hinges on the intentions and sincerity of the off-seer.  At the end of Chapter 3, Noah came to some conclusion about it having more to do with the off-seer than the people who died, almost as if the motes come from the off-seer.

This happened a bit earlier, but an off-seer from Colony Lambda went missing and we found him way out here in Aetia Region.  What's supposed to happen to someone who lives out their 10 years but can no longer have a Homecoming?  (Asking for Mi—uhhh a friend)

After doing as much side quest stuff as I could find, I proceeded on up the Cotte Falls to the next story objective, and WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING DOING IN MY WAY?

It's the same freakin' dragon from just before the final act of XC1. 😵‍💫

As an aside... I always thought that dragon, and indeed everything about Prison Island at the end of the 1st game, felt really out of place, but I guess the common hypothesis is that it was all stuff from previous iterations of Zanza's world, before Homs et al.

After the dragon fight, our heroes remark upon some intrusive noise they hear while interlinked.  I can't help but remember Noah was bothered by an unusual sound a long time back at the Ouroboros Stone, shortly before he first interlinked with Mio.

This neat-looking Moebius woman says N wants P and O to come meet with him.  Then she name drops M, who apparently knows N pretty well, but she's been away for a while?

At one point, Taion shares some thoughts on mortality.  Nimue's life was cut short, but he believes she lives on in people's memories, and particularly those associated with her cherished object (the mechanical pocketwatch).  But if I understand correctly...

At the topmost area of the falls, even in a nighttime storm there are amazing sights.  There's a place called Titan Rock which resembles a XC2 type of titan, but I can't identify which one it might be.  Possibly one of the smaller ones employed by Mor Ardain.

It blows the hell out of some mountains, and the effects were felt by our party some distance away.

Right away, this weapon flies in the face of everything we know about the Keves-Agnus conflict...

First off, this just vaporizes things, which doesn't allow for collection of leftover life force.  And secondly, Keves could use this to destroy all of Agnus, but that would end the war cycle that Moebius needs to perpetuate.

So what is it *really* meant for?

> It's an effective weapon against the City, as we will witness later.  I expect that ever since Matthew unlocked the true Ouroboros power, Moebius has had to focus on serious new methods of fighting back (compared to the peaceful stalemate that existed previously).

Oh well here's a good potential application: extortion!  The Queen is already aiming it at her own subjects to keep them in line.

Now, there's a thing about Xenoblade games: it's an open world and you can almost always backtrack...

...but in both 1 and 2, there was a point toward the end of the story where a significant volume of the world became inaccesible.  At least once it was because a region was utterly destroyed.

As the party approaches a campsite, Mio stumbles.  She doesn't want Noah to worry about it, but something from the back of her mind comes forward.

She stumbled back in the Urayan tunnels too, which at the time seemed like an effect of the gas attack... but now?

At the site, they kinda start stating the obvious, but it's true that they're now actively targeted by the highest levels of power.  They can't move openly anymore, worried only whether soldiers might spot them.

Taion also considers the larger picture.

"Maktha" seems to be a portmanteau of Makna Forest from XC1 and Land of Morytha from XC2.  These buildings are remnants from Earth after Klaus activated the Conduit.  As usual, the characters don't seem to question the existence or the nature of this place.

This is a funny aside, but I think it speaks to how Nopon are wiser of the world due to their longer lifespans.  Humans can only ever focus on the present moment, but Nopon can be much more philosophical.  They're often just bad at communicating that wisdom.

If the world is so messed up, then what purpose does anyone have who had been born into it?  Apparently Taion has given that a great deal of thought, and he provides his logical conclusion.

Alas, I was forced to fight off these Mystery Agnus Ninjas.  After defeating them, they kinda go "aw shucks" and sullenly head back to their home.  We (read as: Noah) choose to check in on them.

There's an Agnian colony nestled in among the buildings, but their flame clock is just about empty.  This is their commander, Juniper (who's really damn cute).  Juniper is referred to as they/them—the first in Xenoblade to do so—and is canonically non-binary.

A datamine of XC3 revealed that characters have a gender value of 0/1 for male/female, except Juniper who has the value 2.

Similarly, in XC2, Roc did not count as male, female, nor beast to qualify for missions that needed those.  But he used he/him pronouns.

Another thing about Juniper is that it's hard to tell if they have Gormotti cat ears, or if those are just hair decorations.  For what it's worth, their English voice actor *is* Welsh (though without as thick an accent as Nia the angry Welsh catgirl had in XC2).

Colony Tau is only rumoured to exist, but here they are.  I guess no other colonies come through these parts, and they lack the resources to get out themselves.  So they're living the "free life" out here, but that likely all ends when their clock hits zero.

They're completely out of touch with the rest of the world.  They know nothing about Ouroboros, and their Consul doesn't even care to come out here.  This could very well be the safest place in the world for our party right now.

CW: suicide

These people are resigned to their fate—they're pretty much suicidal, but they they didn't come to this logically like Taion: they simply aren't aware that any alternative exists.  I guess that makes it easier for them to accept what's coming.

They even claim that this is natural, and that they're doing the honourable thing.  They've pretty much grabbed on to all the excuses they can to believe there is no hope, and I believe it's a kind of mental self-defence to prevent despair.

Oh OF COURSE it's suddenly monsters, and their response is literally "[surrounded by flames] This is fine."  But a crack in the façade appears: Juniper is afraid of losing their comrades.  Turns out it's easier to condemn *yourself* to hopelessness than others.

We fulfilled Juniper's hero quest, so of course they'll come along with us now.  But what's more is several other Colony Tau members will head out, and we'll encounter them among other colonies.  I think not even a dozen people stick around here at this point.

This skill is necessary to progress through Maktha Wildwoods and continue the main story, so like Valdi, Juniper was not an optional hero.

But one more skill remains, and I have no idea what we could be missing at this point.

Colony Tau is also doing a good job of sustaining their own food supply (my first thought was "ZEON HAS TO SEE THIS").  We got here just in time for their harvest, so naturally we're asked to help out.  ...And apparently they need to have a doctor on hand?

I noticed something weird about Juniper: they have a blue diamond shape on the back of their left shoulder.  It seems similar to what's on Teach's face, and it's the same size and shape as what's on Mio's chest.  It would appear to be an Agnian thing.

And Lanz commented on that previously!  Later, during more of the story quest here in Maktha, he chats with Riku and mentions how Kevesis need power frames to enhance their strength, since Agnians are naturally stronger.

Agnians are based on the people of XC2.  Blades (like Sena) were generally superhuman, and they often had a core crystal visible on their body.

But then there were Blade Eaters: humans who incorporated a core crystal into their body to enhance their abilities.

----

I have a suspicion that Agnians who aren't Blades are in fact Blade Eaters.  But it's impossible to tell how they came to be that way.  Either they're born like that, or it might be applied to them later (like a Kevesi would be given a power frame to wear).

----

Mio's crystal is different: it has a swirling red pattern, which is indicative of a Flesh Eater.  That's a Blade who (somehow) consumed their human Driver, so that they will never have to return to their core crystal and be reborn for a different Driver.

----

But here in XC3, Blades like Sena exist without a Driver, and they seem to fall under the "human" umbrella with everyone else.  So it's a mystery why Mio in particular has a red-stained crystal (which looks identical to what Nia had in XC2).

----

Here's something weird I encountered in Maktha: this small Keves-looking Levnis appeared out of nowhere and attacked us.  We fought it off, but then it just went invisible and escaped. 😨

And I seem to have worked out the proper chain attack strategy.  The trick is you always get 3 "normal" orders, but a hero order is free, and you get an Ouroboros order if you complete a character pair on the 3rd order, and by then damage'll be near 1000x. 😵‍💫

The thing about N (even moreso than the other Consuls) is that he is on some stratum so far above these Aionians, he assumes whatever he's doing is mostly incomprehensible to them.  He doesn't even care about keeping secrets from them, 'cause what can they do?

Moebius can evidently track down anyone they want, and Ethel wants to help fight against that.

Maybe she's trying to remain "in" with Moebius, and do more damage from the inside?  It's just hard to believe she's supporting rebellion while she chooses to go all in with killing Ouroboros.  She needs them alive to have any hope of beating Moebius.

Bolearis expects the gang to keep moving on to the Sword, but they feel obligated to change their plans.  They have a chance to get into the Castle and do something about the Annihilator, and they can't allow so many lives to remain at risk of it.

But they need an infiltration plan.  For some reason the Castle is located where there's an arsetonne of black fog, so they actually have a good shot at going undetected (and one of them mentioned that spontaneous annihilation events are curiously rare).

There's a big honkin' hand near here, but it's not mechanical like the Mechonis'.  Nor does it seem nearly as large, so it's hard to say that it belonged to the Bionis.  I've seen some speculate it belonged to the Mor Ardain titan.

I'm confused about the timeline.  So Cammuravi was in prison when N came to him... was he imprisoned immediately after Ethel beat (and spared) him?  That would mean the big Cammuravi Ferronis battle at the beginning of this chapter was a very old flashback.

So these Ferronises possess curious purple flame clocks, tying the two to... "Origin?"  Obviously they're different from the traditional blue/yellow clocks.  And the way P here talks about them, it behaves a bit like two people interlinking. 🤔

I can't tell if these are symptoms of "old age," or if they result from Mio's growing anxiety.  We haven't seen this happen to other late tenth-termers, eg. Mwamba (though we didn't follow him as closely).  Maybe being cut off from the flame clock is a factor.

O and P pop up as well.  Interestingly, Sena recognizes O from Colony Zeta, and presumably P worked with Keves.  We later see that their Irises also follow the usual rule: right eye for Kevesis, left for Agnians.  They must have been soldiers once, like Joran.

Ethel can't be controlled by her Iris anymore, but Cammuravi is fair game for Moebius manipulation.  O pulls off a stunt similar to what K did to Ethel and Colony 4 way back.

...But O never accounted for how STRONG-WILLED and DRAMATIC Cammuravi is!  He gouged his own dang eye out 😬  (I'm certain that would be red blood in the Japanese release)

And I just had to laugh out loud when Ethel and Cammuravi suddenly realized they're free to live how they've always wanted:

Trying to kill each other.

The Ouroboros gang are so genuinely confused right now.

P and O are freaking out at this point, and they try sapping Ethel and Cammuravi's life force, maybe to slow them down.  Again, this seems quite like what K did to Colony 4 before his demise.  It's a bit odd that Noah is surprised by this.

This is becoming a ubiquitous theme: though your life is short, you will affect those around you who live on, and they will carry memories of you.  Your aspirations can still be realized even if not by you.

Ethel never did come back to my hero roster. 😞

Noah is genuinely angry at these Moebius, which is something he almost never lets show.  I think he's normally tempered by not knowing what's truly right or wrong, but he is damned sure of it right now.

So a pair of Moebius can interlink as well.  Note that these two are from Keves and Agnus, respectively, so they're following the same rule as Ouroboros.  The main difference is that Moebius can assume a monstrous form individually to begin with.

...To create an even MORE monstrous form!  They're basically fused at each other's backs, making conversation awkward.

It's funny how they prattle on how *this* is the true, perfect form of interlinking.  ...Though it does imply Ouroboros is lacking something.
