title: I Played Xenoblade Chronicles 3 - Chapter 1
byline: Young soldiers locked into a lifetime of war unveil a secret about their world that somehow makes it all even worse

This was originally written as a long thread on Twitter—that's why it's organized in chunks of up to 280 characters and 4 images.  I've stitched them all together into a single article here.

<div class="box" markdown=1>

### Spoiler Alert

Obviously, this article contains spoilers for Chapter 1 of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__, so you may want to play through that before proceeding.

It also makes the occasional reference back to the first __Xenoblade Chronicles__, its sequel __Xenoblade Chronicles 2__, and the DLC expansions for each: __Future Connected__ and __Torna - The Golden Country__.  Those will add new context to __XC3__, but could be considered minor spoilers for those games.

<div id="spoilerToggleSection"></div>

</div>

I'm 5.5 hours into __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__ and I have to talk about it at length.  I'm going into it having played __XC (DE)__ and __XC2__—though not __XCX__—and there is a lot to compare.

Initial thoughts:

* This game is sparkin' gorgeous.  It must be doing something new with lighting and environmental effects (and they're not blurring everything like in __XC2__)

* I love the red UI theme, which ties into story elements, but I definitely need my reading glasses.

----

* The menus are dense and confusing at first, but being an XC game, it's easing into the complexity bit by bit.

* Thematically this is much like __XC1__: serious war-torn society stuff, not the bright campy nature of __XC2__.  Good lord, this game lays heavy on the topic of indoctrination.

This is a hilarious plot device to make us walk back to base and take in the local sights.  Eunie just accepts it.

I'm reminded of __XC2__'s Bridghid who never opened her eyes, so that when she finally did, you knew something big was up.  Just wait for Eunie to really give a fuck.

The life force of dead soldiers is shown with an interesting visual effect, which made the opening battle look like a veritable bloodbath.  And this from a series that didn't dare show any blood in previous EU/NA releases.

I love Nopon who have shit grammar, but with a "normal" voice and clear enunciation.  __XC2__'s Pupurin (Bana's stooge) was the first and maybe only other example that I can recall.

But Riku is clearly demonstrating to us that even the Nopon of Aionios are grimdark fighters.

COLONY 9.

The blatant irony of a giant Mechon-looking monstrosity named *COLONY 9*.  Shulk would be spinning in his grave.

...And it's just not possible for this to be simple fanservice.  Something is up.

> Given the context of __Future Redeemed__, it's probably safe to say that Shulk *fully supported* this design style.  He would have collaborated with the Machina to build technology for the __XC1__ half of Origin, so it's natural that stuff would resemble Mechon.

> But man, the devs totally threw this at us right from the get-go knowing how series veterans would react.  The name "Colony 9," plotwise, is pure coincidence, but it was certainly selected for maximum fan service.

Eunie got her shower and still isn't taking anyone's shit. 😳

Lanz is clearly this game's Reyn—except Reyn had nothing to prove.

Noah and Eunie are also awfully shulky and melly.  Just interesting, is all.

> It's heavily hinted that Eunie is daughter to Melia—not hard to see where her personality may come from.  Shulk had a son, Nikol (presumably with Fiora), but Noah is definitely not related.  Noah and Lanz were children living on the Bionis as well, and I don't think we have any clues to their parentage, except that Noah may have had the family name of Vandham?

The collectopaedia cards are a neat feature, basically combining __XC1__'s anywhere/anytime collectopaedia rewards with __XC2__'s market exchange.  You can quickly dump your hoard of collectables whenever you like.

The fictional Iris system is neat, and fits right in with the everyone's-born-a-soldier theme.  And what's even neater is that the game's whole UI is made to look like Iris.

I'm trying to figure out the nature of the landmass.  In __XC1__ and __2__ it was well-known to be formed by titans above an endless sea.  Here it's only apparent that there are enormous cliffs over seemingly bottomless chasms.  And no one has offered any exposition about the geography.

Something I need to bring up here is that the voice elements have been stellar.  And it's not just the voice actors doing a superb job: it's been weaved into the gameplay even moreso than in the previous games.

----

We get the usual combat banter (woefully repetitive but helpfully informative).  But now we get environmental cues from the characters too.  It's great when a party member comments on something out of the ordinary or on something we didn't notice.

----

Oh, and the combat announcer from __XC2__ is gone!  The disembodied voice that told you combo status and whether what you did was AWESOME?  It was surprisingly helpful.  The characters still announce their combo moves, but you have to pay more attention to whether they succeeded.

----

An interesting addition in __XC3__ is elite enemies.  They're more challenging (not as much as named enemies), but they respawn like any other mob.  I find they're located near points of interest, kinda guarding them.  And they have great battle music.

And skirmishes!  Once in a while you'll stumble upon two parties in battle, and you're to choose which side you want to support.  I can tell this will become more interesting in later chapters, but right now I'm a bit bummed I can't help the bunnits.

However, this section was quite linear, and boy did it set the mood.  The music was notably low and simple, and combat used a unique tune with a similar motif.  I've always thought XC could use better blending of environmental and battle music, just like this.

> The music here is the same as in the very first segment of the game (the combat tutorial in Everblight Plain).  But there was so much going on in that segment that I wasn't paying proper attention to the background music.  This Alfeto Valley segment is more of a quiet infiltration, which makes the music stand out even more.

We were warned about this black fog earlier.  I'm certain it's more than a convenient plot device.

...And uh, now we've got some mysterious new creepy dude?

Noah pointed out that both armies had disappeared and that his and Mio's crews were the only ones still fighting.  He was also detecting some strange noise.  I think it was all this guy's doing.

> Okay!  So, there's a lot happening here that can go entirely unnoticed, unless you've played further and then come back to this.

> First off, Noah had a curious internal monologue, during which he wasn't sure where his thoughts were coming from.  It was confusing, and could be chalked up to him growing anxious, alongside the general mysterious supernatural stuff going on.  But it was very likely *the experience of all his past lives*.  For one thing, he died at the hands of Moebius so many times (as revealed at the start of Chapter 6), that he could be subconsciously predicting his own demise here.  And for another thing, that desire to escape and save himself is arguably something that distinguishes N from Noah, whereas Noah instead chose to stand his ground here.

> The unusual sound he mentioned is quite possibly related to the interlink of D and J, who just came onto the scene.  It's impossible to know it at this point, but this monster is an interlinked pair of Moebius: notice there are two cores.

> And interlinks have a time limit, with the participants hearing an annoying sound growing ever louder.  I wouldn't be surprised if Noah—given his past lives' history with Ouroboros Stone research—can sense that from someone else's interlink.

----

Vandham was always good at improvising in a pinch.  He said he was supposed to get this Ouroboros Stone to the city, but that sure ain't happening now, so may as well get some use out of it.

Wow, this Moebius dude's a real jerk.  But what's interesting is his resemblance to Noah and Mio's interlinked form.  And it's pretty clear now that Moebius is keeping Keves and Agnus from combining forces and threatening their power.

> Interestingly, the design of Ouroboros interlink forms and of Moebius monster forms is never addressed (although the latter actually gets mocked at one point).  The Xeno series has always had a certain pedigree of technological/supernatural visual design, and it's not hard to chalk this up to more of that.

> But I'm sure something can be inferred from it: like how the Ouroboros power was created by Nia, and then further empowered by Logos and Pneuma—all of them artificial beings.  And how Moebius are given power by Z, fueled by exceptionalism and the fear of change.

----

Now here's some speculation.  Remember the black fog from earlier?  There's a parallel here to the __XC:DE__ expansion, __Future Connected__.  In that, some kind of rift opened up over Alcamoth, and from it came some abominable entity called the Fog King.

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

Well... Aionios seems to have been born from some massive rift between universes.  Was __Future Connected__ the beginning of that event?  And could this Moebius monstrosity be at all related to the Fog King?

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1554156051498520579-FZF4sTJXkAEdOUR.jpg)

(As an aside, the shape of the Fog King seems the same as a large Guldo from __XC2__, Guldos being the remnants of Earth society on Alrest.  Might just be innocuous 3D model reuse though, 'cause I think that red string runs far too long on the conspiracy corkboard)

> Wherever I was going with that was definitely not right.  Moebius are not related to the fogbeasts.  It's hard to tell exactly how the fogbeasts do fit in, it was kinda handwaved away in __Future Redeemed__.

----

See, an entire society composed of anime teenagers is NOT NORMAL.

But an interesting choice of words from Vandham here, since we must assume that Noah is technically a Homs.  There are no humans in Keves (__XC1__), but there are in Agnus (__XC2__).

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1554313537383710720-FZIH6znX0AI5jTn.jpg)

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1554313537383710720-FZIH7BxWYAMqYkY.jpg)

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1554313537383710720-FZIH7LWXkAAGUEj.jpg)

</div>

----

In fact, let's address the torta in the room: nothing is mentioned at all about race so far (aside from recognizing Nopon as some weird other thing).  Keves is full of Homs, High Entia, and Machina—the races of __XC1__.  But Agnus is perhaps weirder...

----

__XC2__ had an explicit divide between humans and Blades.  Even the cat-eared Gormotti, feathered Urayans, and blue-skinned Indolines fell into the "human" category.  So Agnus seems to consist of Humans and Blades... but not the kind of human as this Vandham.

----

I'll bet anyone new to Xenoblade is wondering "what's up with these different people?"  But like the absence of info on the geography, the lack of explanation of different races—in itself—is not an issue.  To experienced players it's just plain *suspicious*.

----

Vandham's pulling off military operations at 60, so "normal" human lifespan must not be far off from IRL.  And he reinforces the idea that the lives of Kevesis and Agnians are not natural—their societies are being manipulated.

Despite being "real" humans, Vandham and co. still leave behind their life force, and they need to be sent off like everyone else (lest they be absorbed to fuel more war).

And I believe this lends more evidence for my big hypothesis:

I believe people who died in the previous game worlds are being reincarnated here in Aionios.  There is clearly a kind of life force or "soul" in everyone, but we don't know from where it originated, or how long it's been around.

----

In this case, Vandham grew up to be much like his former self back in Alrest, although they could have been hundreds or thousands of years apart—and maybe many more Vandhams were born and had died in-between.

> It turned out to be less simple than that: Guernica Vandham is technically a descendant of Noah and Mio 😬

----

And Shulk, Reyn, and Melia would eventually die as well, and their souls would move on, and wouldn't it be neat if they ended up together again in a sequel?

One more point of support here is how Noah's sword looks very Monadoey.

----

The Monado is more of a person's will than a physical object, and it's easy to imagine any reincarnation of Shulk would possess one as well.

This all holds up for our Keves heroes, but again... Agnus is *weird*.

----

Mio looks like a complete Nia rip-off, right down to the bloodied core crystal in her chest... but her personality is NOT Nia's.  Taion isn't like any specific __XC2__ character that I can remember.  And Sena... I mean how does that even work for Blades?!?

> Just as with Eunie, it's strongly hinted that Mio is daughter of Nia, so again, my theory was supplanted by simple heredity.  But still... how *does* it work for Blades?  Well, it must be pretty simple, because Rex figured it out with three of them!

> In __Future Redeemed__, Rex even points out how core crystal shape is inherited by children from the mother.  That was how he could be certain Glimmer was his daughter (since she possessed the green Conduit-shaped core of Pyra).  With that in mind, it's virtually guaranteed that Mio is Nia's daughter.

> (And this presents an interesting implication for Sena, whose blue fiery hair and circular core crystal are very much like Bridghid's in __XC2__.)

> Anyway, there's a potential argument that whatever mechanism Origin used to store and then restore lives would make everyone biologically alike, whether they started as a Homs, Machina, Blade, or whatever.  But that doesn't explain how Blades were bearing humans' kids *before* the Intersection blew everything up.

> (Old Klaus' creations are just full of surprises)

----

It's like __XC3__ is toying with us.  There are these blatant callbacks to previous games, but they aren't consistent far enough to really declare a pattern.  And it could still all be as innocuous as fan service.

Anyway I could keep playing and find out, but yeah.

----

Um, NO ONE controls Eunie. 

Neat that __XC3__ forces you to play as other characters.  In __XC1__ and __2__ you could play the whole game as Shulk/Rex and never touch someone else (which seemed like a huge waste of development).

> Just a minor nitpick against myself here, but __XC1__ did indeed briefly force you to play as characters other than Shulk.  __XC2__ did not, which is a shame because how many people missed the experience of riding atop Dromarch as Nia?

----

Melnath was presumably the name of the titan where Gormott was located in __XC2__.  We only know this because Gormott contained an area called FREAKIN' MELNATH'S SHOULDER.

Someone should compare the geography of that to this... since I won't do it right now

> Apparently, this entire area *and* Upper Aetia are the remains of the Gormott titan, rendered nearly unrecognizable by annihilation events.

----

Then you play as Mio and OMG, KEVES ARTS ARE CIRCLES AND AGNUS ARTS ARE DIAMONDS 😱

This game has basically crammed the combat system of __XC1__ into that of __XC2__, right down to the UI shapes they used.

My goodness, this is still Chapter 1??

So Moebius did something to make everyone believe our heroes must be killed.  According to these comments, they may appear to everyone as a soldier from the enemy side.  Is Moebius simply manipulating the Iris system?

Okay, the chapter finally ended shortly after that.  I could only tell because the customary XC between-chapter save screen came up.  Kinda weird there's no clear distinction, I didn't even know Ch. 1 was titled "Ouroboros" until I went to the Event Theatre.
