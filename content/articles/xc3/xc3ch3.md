This was originally written as a long thread on Twitter—that's why it's organized in chunks of up to 280 characters and 4 images.  I've stitched them all together into a single article here.

<div class="box" markdown=1>

### Spoiler Alert

Obviously, this article contains spoilers for Chapters 3 and earlier of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__, so you may want to play through those before proceeding.

It also makes the occasional reference back to the first __Xenoblade Chronicles__, its sequel __Xenoblade Chronicles 2__, and the DLC expansions for each: __Future Connected__ and __Torna - The Golden Country__.  Those will add new context to __XC3__, but could be considered minor spoilers for those games.

*Additionally*, I've added a few new entries which contain spoilers for *the entirety of __Xenoblade Chronicles 3__* (including DLC expansion __Future Redeemed__).  *But those will be hidden by default.*  Click here if you would like to view those as well:

</div>

At this time I haven't finished Chapter 3 yet, and I've spent about 30 hours on the game.  I'm doing everything I possibly can, like exploring all the nooks and crannies, and doing all the side quests.  I'm slowly savouring this experience. 😔

----

I'm actually surprised by how few quests have been available so far.  Instead of people just dumping fetch quests on you like in __XC1__/__2__, there's more variety here in how you obtain quests and in how to increase affinity.

----

I suppose the collectopaedia cards make up for a lot of it, but Chapter 3 is where a lot of nitty-gritty features seem to be introduced, so the possible application of those ought to increase.  And we'll find ourselves backtracking to some earlier areas.

----

The chapter opens up with a Taion flashback, where we find him lobbying for a strategic attack plan, but his superior insists their lowly Keves opponent can be crushed by a simple, full frontal assault.

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

----

The colony commander, Isurd, is more receptive.

After this scene, Keves surprise attacks Colony Lambda, and it looks like all the planning was made moot.  Only Taion and a few other lower-ranks made it out.

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1557096902088396800-FZvrYUBWIAcbLZc.jpg)

</div>

> Daaaaaang, Taion just went over the head of his superior.  Later in the game, it's made painfully clear just how process-oriented Colony Lambda is, and this act of insubordination would hardly fly with Isurd.  If this isn't just a simple plothole, does this mean Lambda was much less strict before the disaster?  

> Meanwhile, I wonder if Taion's plan resulted in a delay of action.  Had Lambda simply gone for a frontal attack, perhaps they would have done so sooner, before the Keves sneak attack.

> If that were the case, then just imagine how Isurd must have felt afterward for forgiving Taion's indiscretion.  On top of Isurd developing anger toward Taion, it would surely serve as his motivation to introduce strict operational procedures.

> (And it's possible that was actually stated outright at some point and I simply missed it)

----

But before that, we're introduced to Chekhov's Gizmo, which is given to Taion before he escapes.

One other thing was that Keves used a purple smokescreen in their attack—related to the dark fog?

> I don't remember the gizmo ever actually being needed in-game for time-keeping.  Instead, it served as a physical memento of a deceased person, a concept which the protagonists needed to learn about.

> Though at the very end, Taion casually used it to tell how long they had before Origin would reset their worlds.  At that point, it's likely that the Irises no longer functioned, and the gizmo finally proved its technical worth.

Back to these mudders in the present.  I'm trying to keep track of who's who: D was the first one, at the Ouroboros Stone.  P made fun of him afterward, and apparently J had put him up to it.  H "wiped out" Colony 8 some time before.  K was at Ethel's Colony 4.

And Z is some mysterious fellow with glowy scars who doesn't wear a funny suit.

Here D explains why it's so important to actually go out there and experience things for yourself.

So now this little one wants to give it a go.  But how is Isurd involved?  Is he still around after the Keves attack on his colony?

Back at Colony 4, we learn how Ethel ended up commander of a dirt-rank colony: she defeated her equal from Agnus, but let him live.  The Keves Castle didn't like that.  (Also, here are some fighters in giant mecha in case you weren't sure this was a Xeno title)

This is neat: a quest target can be a character, and they can move, forcing you to follow them.

There's no auto-follow functionality, though there is auto-run (introduced in __XC: Definitive Edition__).  You can even adjust the speed of auto-run (-walk/-meander).

Neat new quest thing: NPCs have always casually bantered between themselves while you're passing by, but now some of the stuff you overhear will be things you can actually involve yourself in.  The next time you make camp, the crew decide whether to act on it.

Sometimes there isn't even a quest involved, but it leads the group to discuss amongst themselves and consider what they're doing (or what formations they should use in battle).

Now, for anyone who thought there weren't enough simultaneous combatants in __XC2__... a hero joins our party to make it seven!

The long-term effect of this is the core six can learn the hero's class and get new arts (and outfits!).

Had to whoop his arse first, though.

But this is curious: Valdi doesn't see Ouroboros as monsters.  Instead, he's simply been told there's a bounty on these guys.  So has Moebius given up on the Iris manipulation thing?

Of course we trashed his Levnises in self-defence, and he can't get back to his colony without the spare parts to fix them, and we're a crew of altruistic do-gooders, therefore: fetch quest!

Oops, we spent all that time fixing Valdi's junk, Consul Q shows up to browbeat him for being AWOL.

Later in this chapter there's a big deal made out of how Agnus had only recently developed autonomous, pilotless Levnises, which implies that every one we've seen until now (or at least, every one of Keves) had a pilot aboard it.

Uhhhhh... I couldn't help but overhear...

Up until now, we've been prevented from going back to Yzana or Everblight, because our old pals at Colony 9 are hanging out around there.  But maybe now's the time for the band of deserters to drop by again.

Along the way, we stumble upon this poor Agnian woman, Kyrie (who sounds extremely Ardanian).  She's from Colony Gamma—Mio, Sena, and Taion's old squad, which was there at the Ouroboros Stone debacle.  They've all been assuming the three were lost in action.

This pretty much confirms it: the red Irises and monster appearances were a temporary measure by Moebius.  It's possible they can't maintain that influence indefinitely, or across a particularly large area.  This is also why Valdi was so chill with our crew.

Speaking of... I never knew any of this: in __XC1__ the commander's name was Vangarre, but in the Japanese release his name was *Vandham*.  There was a Vandham in __XCX__ as well, but the __XC2__ and __3__ Vandhams share the closest resemblance.  From

So this Zeon's in charge now.  He wants proof that Noah and friends can be trusted.  He's ill-prepared to fight against Agnus.  So he's putting them on the front line of their defense.  Kinda hoping they aren't secretly Agnus agents...

> I think Zeon's little head-wings are great.  For one thing, it's part of a rare but notable kind of diversity within the different races (like varying wing colours among High Entia, and different ear types among Gormottis).

> But secondly, it calls back to __XC1__ in which Melia was the one with unusually small wings (owing to her part-Homs lineage), for which she received some amount of ridicule and disrespect.  Zeon stands in stark contrast to that, being a respected leader, which reinforces how Aionians pay no heed to these biological differences.

So an advance troop of Agnians arrives, but we whoop them.  They decide to back off, and we go ahead and let them.  This whole "mercy" thing is foreign to most Aionians.

But I almost forgot: Aionians can't have nice things.  So Consul B shows up to remind Zeon that Ouroboros is the enemy (without doing anything about it himself).

The Consul calls them all "drones," an interesting descriptor: is it that they're all replaceable?

Curiously, B disappears in a puff of white motes, instead of leaving behind a body with red motes.  He sent himself off?

I don't know if he means the regular people of Aionios are fated for doom and despair, or if that includes people like himself as well.

> It *is* a bit curious that B disappeared very quickly, while K's corpse stuck around long enough to debate over.  But it can basically be chalked up to what best served the storytelling: they had to unmask K, but unmasking every other Consul would get repetitive (and require many unique faces to be modeled by the developers).

> Ha, some Nopon literally have "???" for their age.  But Aionios has been around for over 1000 years, and not all Nopon are *that* long-lived (presumably not many more than seven of them), so there are definitely many generations of them going back to the Intersection of two worlds.

> When the people of those worlds were preserved within Origin, it's possible that Nopon were included.  However, it seems that those people are only restored by the will of Z, and even then it's either ten-year olds who will ultimately enter the cycle of death and rebirth, or those who became the first Consuls.

> So it's likely that Nopon came to Aionios some other way.  Though it's funny to think they "fell into" Aionios during the Intersection, there's virtually no evidence that anyone survived that ordeal outside of Origin.  So it's more likely that living Nopon were onboard Origin (as it seems Shulk, Rex, and *maybe* the Queens were?).  They could very well have served as Origin's maintainers right up to the Intersection.

There were no quests or anything, just a big Xenoblade playground.  Though there was a bunch of hidden things, including this crazy tunnel system with bizarre puzzle mechanisms.

Okay back to the main story finally 😭

We're treated to a cutscene of Moebius, revealing that the place they meet up at is a big empty theatre—film projector and all.  Very different style from Aionios in general.  And they're watching our party's every move.

It sounds like they're talking about the realization that there's *supposed* to be more to life, and then despairing that it's too late to fix it for yourself.  It feels like these guys know that feeling very well.

This monstrosity is definitely Moebius (the figure-8 symbol can be seen), and it's the cause of Colony 18's utter destruction.  But I don't think we've seen before a Moebius monster move this fast, or emit this kind of energy.

Why would Moebius destroy this flame clock?  It's supposed to help sustain them.  Is it to do with it being gold?

Also, this is not the Colony 8 that was mentioned as being destroyed by H, and I wonder if that one ended up with this same fate.

At this point, Eunie may have been the last soldier standing.  The monster goes straight to her, and slowly aims his claw-thing directly toward her Iris eye.  Based on the corpse earlier, she was left in this position, petrified like stone.  It's... unsettling.

So: was that really Eunie, who is now reincarnated into her current existence?  If so, that battle would have been 9ish or more years ago (unknown if she would be immediately reborn in a new first-term body, or if there was time in-between).

----

Does this happen to everyone after they die?  Hard to say: Eunie died in a unique way, leaving behind a corpse in a state we've never seen before.  And we don't know what happens to someone's "spirit" if it's collected by a clock (or Moebius), or else sent off.

> It turns out that she left a standard husk like all soldiers do who are killed for their life force.  It had just been a while since I last saw a "standard" Keves-Agnus skirmish, plus the dead Eunie was made to really stand out compared to the rest of the destruction.

Oh hey, I was wrong about the Great Sword!  Early in the game, we were positioned so that the sword looked like it was inside (what I later learned was) the ocean vortex.  But now we can see it clearly with nothing blocking it.

Plus there are more pretty views.

I never mentioned this before, but __XC3__ has a brilliant screenshot feature that hides the game UI.  Just press L+R.  The trouble is it also hides the subtitles and character dialogue, so if I'm capturing a conversation I still use the Switch's screenshot button.

Remember the special forces team from Colony Iota?  Turns out they're milling around in different places with some soldier units.  I took down Claire, but this guy and one other were too strong for me at the time (while I continue to overpower the story quests).

omgomgomg we're going into sparkin' Uraya.

We've entered the 3rd region of Aionios, and revealed another little patch of world.

It seems to be an intentional design decision for __XC3__ to use flat, single-level maps, which is annoying when surfaces overlap.

__XC2__ was already a bit frustrating with vertical maze-like areas like Gormott depicted by a single 2D map surface, but it still had separate levels for some places.  Meanwhile __XC:DE__ had some areas with, like, 10 separate floors, and the mapping was fantastic.

> More map levels actually appear later on as new areas are discovered, so it wasn't entirely as bad as I'd feared.

----

In __XC2__, Uraya was a nation inside a giant sea-dwelling titan—which is now in Aionios, quite dead, and with a giant chunk of it vaporized.

Surprisingly, the music here is a reprise of the Bionis' Interior from __XC1__, making a spooky and nostalgic combination.

The combat music is different now too, having switched to "Agnus Battle."  It's a refreshing change; as much as I appreciate the INTENSE FLUTING of "Keves Battle," it was growing stale.

Sadly, battles are so short, I don't hear much more than the intro 😅

----

On that note, I may as well rant: mobs can be aggressive (they attack you on sight), or passive.  And even if they're aggressive, they won't attack if you're much higher leveled than them.  So it's easy to pass through prior regions without interruption.

----

So there are some monster types that you never need to fight (aside from elites/uniques): garaffas, camills, kapybas, armus, etc.  But that means you never get their loot drops, and you end up lacking items for quests/gems/cooking.

----

I don't want to slay a cute kapyba just so Manana can cook with its fat. 😣

The Nopon caravans at colonies do happen to sell loot items, so maybe that's a way to resolve this, but you have to know exactly what specific items you're looking for.

This is just like in __XC1__, where you would collect crystals from solid ether deposits, and then you could produce gems from them.  But so far we're not finding anything other than regular ol' mineral-type loot.

THAT'S MOTHERSNUFFING FONSA MYMA.  ...Or rather, what's left of it.

Fonsa Myma was capital of Uraya in __XC2__, and it was a mostly vertical city with a tall palace at the top.

I had to fire up __XC2__ again and compare some vantage points.

It was hard to get views that lined up precisely.  It's possible the surfaces all shifted around when the titan arrived here (and clearly a lot of ground is now missing).  And perhaps mining has really altered the landscape.

> It's possible it had already been ruined before the Intersection of the two worlds.  Who knows exactly what happened after the titans all settled in one place at the end of __XC2__; the events there could have caused some amount of destruction.  And the Urayans wouldn't have to live there anymore, instead moving onto land.

> If the city *was* intact at the end, then the Intersection event could have damaged it.  We don't know how the two worlds' land masses interacted exactly, and it could have been pretty rough (which would explain the condition of the rest of Uraya).

> Finally, could Fonsa Myma have actually come into Aionios intact, and then decayed over the next millennium?  I don't think we know enough about just how frozen in time everything is.  We have seen that annihilation events leave pieces of land detached and floating in mid-air, so does that imply everything would last forever if left untouched by people?

> Sadly, these ruins don't provide any answers, and I need to find more notable landmarks that might provide further clues.

And there were once Saffronia trees everywhere.

Uraya was kind of the analogue to Satorl Marsh from __XC1__: dark but colourful wetlands.

Oh my god, there's still gromrice growing around the old city 😭

Back in the day, there was a great honkin' staircase that led all the way up from the bottom of the titan, through the arch under the palace, then further up to the outside.

We make camp inside the ruin of a watchtower.  I'm guessing "Seebu" is what people of Aionios called this site.  That doesn't ring any bells for me from __XC2__, but reading up on Uraya led me to an interesting possibility...

<div class="imgblock" markdown="1">

![](%assets_url%/xc3/1559411726499680256-FaQks4YXkAAyL8p.jpg)

In Japan, Uraya was called Invidia—Latin for "envy."  The English name is derived from the Japanese word for "envy," which in hiragana is うらやむ: "urayamu."  But in kanji, it's 羨望: "senbō."  It might be a stretch, but "Seebu" could derive from that.

----

And furthermore!  Each nation in Alrest resided on or in a titan, but the titans themselves sometimes had their own name distinct from those living on them.  Argentum's main titan was Goldmouth; Tantal's was Genbu.  Perhaps Uraya's titan had a name like Seebu?

> The selection of place names in Aionios remains a mystery.  I expect they were mostly chosen by the first Consuls, who could have memories of these original locations in Zanza's world and in Alrest.  Or else they would have newly-invented names, entirely divorced from the past, if anyone else had discovered them first.

----

There were two watchtowers over the city, with an ornamental bridge between them.  It wasn't flat and solid like it is here and now—a welcome decision by the devs, because it was really difficult (and completely unnecessary) to cross in __XC2__.

Scaffolding has been built on the far tower, allowing us to climb to the top of it, where a long cable runs over the chasm toward the palace.  I don't have a traversal skill to get me over there yet, so I sadly have to pass it by for now. 😔

We get to access very little of the titan's interior, compared to __XC2__ where it was massive.  We're in the stomach, with the palace located at the bottom of this map.  Beyond the top of this map is a bunch of sprawling passageways leading to the mouth.

There's no massive hole in the top or side of this stomach area, so I have to guess the chunk of titan that got annihilated must be above and forward of the stomach.  Where we are now, we're only heading downward.  ...Through this lovely web-covered passageway.

Not far from the spider nest, we can see another long cable leading to a distant floating island, which is surrounded by black fog.  What's up with that?  Again, I have no way over there yet (I don't even know if that skill is available in this chapter).

> I'm convinced that the black fog was originally intended to play a bigger part in general gameplay.  Whenever we encounter it, it's like a barrier we need to cross to reach our next destination (whether it's for the main story or optional).  And the characters will always comment on how dangerous the fog is when they pass through.

> I would not be surprised if there was a game mechanic planned which had to be scrapped during development—perhaps it didn't enhance the game at all, it proved too difficult, or it wasn't finished in time for the release deadline.

> My favourite hypothesis is that our party could hide in the fog to avoid detection from Moebius or other colonies (which ended up being addressed in a different way in Chapter 5).  More likely, it could have served to harm the party, perhaps if you spent too long in it—you would have to take care not to be caught in combat in the fog.  But it would be pretty frustrating to die to that kind of circumstance.

We continue on, entering an enclosed tunnel... then suddenly, purple smoke fills the space.  Soldiers start coming at us out of nowhere, impossible to pin down.

Mio even has trouble walking normally—this could be a nerve agent.

Yep, Taion remembers this happening before, back when his Colony Lambda attempted an attack on Colony 13.  The Kevesis made their own stealth counterattack under cover of smoke.

It seems clear now this isn't related to black fog, this is military stuff.

Lanz makes an excellent observation, and Taion is making some kind of connection: these Agnians learned this technique after it was once used against them.

Just like Nimue once forced him to flee such an attack, Taion recognizes they've got to get out of there.

Of course, we know the Consul did something to Isurd.  For everything we know about this commander, he was always a calm and caring person.

But Taion is not taking this well.  He thinks he broke this man who trusted him, and who Taion deeply respected.

We actually do enough damage to knock the bugger off-balance, but that just makes Isurd go nuts with the weaponry.  He ends up hurting his own army more, but Taion's still in shock and Eunie has to save him from the assault.

Mio has seen Noah's memories, due to interlinking with him.  Figures Joran would be prominent among them.

I'm not sure what to make of Joran's explanation here, it sounds like he knows what happened to himself but doesn't quite remember experiencing it?

> The closest we ever get to seeing how a typical Consul is made is with Shania, but even with her, she awoke after it had already happened.  Notably, Shania died knowing she would return, so she was better prepared for that continuity of consciousness.  Joran died expecting *not* to be resurrected, so I'm sure the experience was a huge shock to him.

> But there was also Noah/N's conversion to Moebius, during which Noah actually conversed with Z about getting Moebed, and he could recall everything afterward.  It's pretty clear, though, that Noah was a special case: dude uniquely possessed the Sword of Origin, and Z had faced off against him and tried to turn him many, many times before.

----

His Moebius name is simply his first initial.  ...Does this mean every member's name is based on their original name?

And he was granted a special power, but who the heck is the one capable of doing that for every Moebius member?  (My first guess would be Z)

> We can assume Eunie was never more than a standard soldier, and therefore had no value to Moebius.  Joran had a unique connection to the future Ouroboros crew... but that wasn't actually known until they got zapped by the Ouroboros Stone *6 or 7 years after Joran died*.  And Moebius J was literally present already when that took place.

> So by the time of his death, Joran must have been notable merely by who he associated with.  This supports the hypothesis that Noah was a known, unique threat to Moebius throughout history.  Indeed, as per the opening of Chapter 6, Noah repeatedly got taken in by the City during his previous lives, and regularly ended up working with the Ouroboros Stones.  And furthermore, here in the present, Noah had been split off from N, and the true Ouroboros power had finally been unlocked, making him even more of a ticking time bomb for Moebius.

> So it's not a stretch for Z to have picked Joran out early on, as an ace to keep up his sleeve.  Heck, he would probably have Moebed Lanz and Eunie if they ever bit it before getting this far.  And to drive the point home, we will eventually encounter Consul C, who had been very close to our current Noah.

----

Of course we had to fight him, but we couldn't finish him off.  Afterward, Lanz recalled how the "real" Joran was so selfless, he sacrificed himself to save Lanz during the Colony 14 disaster.  ...Though to be fair, Joran may have been suicidal.

It sounds like Joran believes this is his reward for his sacrifice.  He says he owes it to Noah and friends, but how much does he mean that?  It remains to be seen how he reconciles that with Moebius' need to eliminate Ouroboros.

It's all short-lived, as an Agnian takes revenge for her commander, then a Kevesi takes revenge against her.

But then we're at Moebius HQ to see the scene being played out as a literal game on a board.  How much control did they have over the actual battle?

N and Z are observing, and it's kinda refreshing to see N's disgust at this.  Also funny how N is impatient with Z's demeanor.

This jives with the theory that the Consuls are bribed with decadent lives in exchange for their services (as pawns themselves).

> I'm sure that N never let go of how Z antagonized him as Noah for so long.  And N only became Moebius to be with M; he could probably not care less about Z's motivations.

> And with that in mind, it makes even more sense how he ended up helping Matthew and unlocking the Ouroboros power: it served his own purposes at the time, and he's fine if it ends up hurting Moebius.

Z does some vague rambling—he knows all sorts of truths but he's not eager to share. 😒

Z's appearance is curious: he'd be a __XC2__ Blade if anything, but my impression is he's something new.  I'm also wondering, as chief bad guy, how he might be related to Klaus.

> So there's a neat rabbit-hole to follow!  Z is a creation of Origin, and Origin was controlled by the Trinity Processors—particularly Ontos (since Pneuma and Logos kinda... died or something at the end of __XC2__, but their cores needed to be present to keep Ontos balanced).  At the beginning of __Future Redeemed__, Z even speaks directly to Alpha/Ontos, calling him "my god," implying Ontos to be his creator. 
So the creation of Z kinda mirrors how Blades came to exist in Alrest in __XC2__ (but that happened at the direct behest of Klaus; who knows what exactly triggered Z to be born).

...That was the end of Chapter 3. 😮‍💨  It covered a lot of ground, particularly the heroes and liberation of colonies.  Many of those seem to be optional side things, but Valdi and Colony 30 were necessary to continue the story.

----

It seems I was on the right track regarding resurrection, though we only have confirmation of dead Aionians being reborn into the same form again.  But who knows how long that cycle might have been going on, or how someone could change over the decades?

----

Regarding the Consuls: I notice how Joran is J, and his suit resembled a jester.  There are other examples of alliteration: G (at Teach's Colony Lambda) was a gorilla, and D looks like a horned demon.  And N looks like Noah lol.

----

But no clue what K (Colony 4), B (Colony 9), Q (Colony 30), or P are meant to look like.  O looks like a giant penguin, but I don't know an O word that fits.

As for names... are there prominent dead people so far in __XC3__ who could have been Moebed?  I can't come up with any right now.

Also I'm wondering if N could be Noah while Noah is still alive?  And can Z be related to Zanza?

----

Finally, I need to know what's up with the death motes and off-seeing.  Taion commented that life comes from the Queen, and returns to the Queen 10 years later at Homecoming.  But for those who die in battle he doesn't know.  Homecoming does involve an off-seer.

----

When killed prematurely, a body gives off red motes which can be absorbed by a flame clock.  And that collected energy can then feed other living beings... so does that consume the spirit?  If so, does that prevent it from being resurrected?

----

Off-seeing obviously converts that life force somehow, and who knows where it then ends up.  But it stands to reason, if off-seeing at a Homecoming returns a life to the Queen, it would also do so for a life ended prematurely.

Did Joran get sent off?  Or Eunie?

> At the end of Chapter 5, N famously informs Noah that a 10-termer sent off at their Homecoming *does not* return to the cycle.  And there is indeed a big difference between death and a Homecoming: the latter sees off a *living* person.

> So it seems that dying before your full 10 terms gets you thrown back in again, regardless of how you died.  And that's independent of whether your life force was absorbed, or if you were sent off after dying.  And we later see a flashback of Mio naturally reaching her 10-term limit, so we know that results in resurrection, too.

> Furthermore, there was a time before off-seeing even existed: back then, Homecoming consisted of a ceremonial beheading. 😬  Ashera had made it to that Homecoming several times, to the point that she retains the subconscious sensation of her past deaths, but proving that it did not prevent her resurrection.  Crys was the "father of off-seeing" who proposed it as a more palatable reward for 10-termers, but interestingly, it turned Homecoming into a way to keep those successful veterans from coming back and building up an unhealthy habit of questioning their entire existence.

----

And why a flute?  Is there something in particular about a wind instrument that converts the motes, or is it more a magic object kind of deal?  It appears off-seers learn the skill, and some can even lose it, so it's not a trait that anyone is born with.
