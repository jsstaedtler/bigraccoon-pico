I had picked up Xenoblade Chronicles 3 when it was released for the Nintendo Switch, back on July 29, 2022.  I was completely sucked in, and I had a lot of questions and ideas as I progressed—but no one to share them with.  So I took to dumping it all out into a thread on Twitter.

At first it wasn't too deep, just my reactions to parts of the game.  But as I progressed, I started to produce an actual detailed analysis of what was going on, and relating it to the previous Xenoblade games as well.

To top it off, I was taking screenshots of the occasional cool event or funny piece of dialogue... but because of this burgeoning thread, I ended up documenting the game with screenshots.  By the end, I had more than 22,000 images, and they were central to the running analysis.

Now, more than a year later, those tweets are gone, but I've extracted them from an archive and stitched them together into actual articles, one per chapter of the game.  Sadly, I had only gotten near the end of Chapter 4 before I stopped documenting and turned to just playing out the rest of the game.  But I could always pick up where I left off and continue the analysis if I feel like it.

One final note on this project: at the time, I wrote each thread as I was playing through the game, with no knowledge of what was still to come.  Presently, having completed the game, I have a new perspective on the experience—which sometimes proves my earlier ideas completely wrong.  So I've added new content to each article to include my present thoughts.  But whereas each article used to contain spoilers for just that chapter of the game, they now contain spoilers for the *entire* game.  However!  The new content is hidden by default, and you can choose whether to display it.  Therefore, if you've only completed Chapter 1 of the game, feel free to read the Chapter 1 article without fear of spoiling the rest of the game.
