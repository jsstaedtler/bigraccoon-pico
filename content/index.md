I'm **Johann Sebastian Staedtler** (he/him).  ...Not the German guy who made pencils in the 1800s; I'm a Canadian who likes to draw and spend way too much time online.

I'm paid to be an IT administrator and network analyst.  I live in the **Greater Toronto Area**, but I'm an **Ottawa Senators** fan (so when the Leafs lose, just know that I'll be happy).

I'm not a capital-G gamer, but I do have a decent ratio of games played to games owned on Steam.  And you're likely to find me digging into the detailed minutia of the **Xenoblade** series.

I'm a dirty anti-capitalist lefty (without the dirt), and you won't find me on the corporate social media behemoths.  I happily promote **[Mastodon](https://fedi.garden/)** and other platforms on the Fediverse, and you'll find me at **[@jsstaedtler@mastodon.art](https://mastodon.art/@jsstaedtler)**.  Check out the **[Links page](%base_url%/links)** for more ways to follow my work and support me.

Thank you for your interest and your audience!
