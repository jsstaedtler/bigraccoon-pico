#### To complete before release
* JS on page load to see if checkboxes are checked, and if so, to activate their feature (eg. text style, spoiler reveal)
* Test site with JS disabled
* On mobile, close menu after clicking back-to-top button
* In mobile menu, remove circle around back-to-top button
* Does main logo at the top of each page, or the copyright footer, need a border or dropshadow?
* Piwigo
	* Adjust page header to integrate it better with the Pico site
	* Change to a light theme?
	
#### After release
* Somehow reset page top periodically, so the navbar doesn't stick in the wrong places?
	* Or reset when scrolling back to the top?
* Click images to zoom in on them in a lightbox view
* Add dark-mode toggle
* Replace fontawesome icons with SVG files
* Get rid of jQuery
	* Figure out how that "scrolly" thing works to smoothly move between points on the page
* Split <HEAD> of templates into reusable segment
* Add comments using Mastodon
* Introduce a highlight colour, or make tinted instead of plain black?  Brownish (like a raccoon)?
* Rebuild gallery in Pico
