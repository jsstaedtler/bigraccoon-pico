* Test site in Chrome, Safari, Edge, IE(?)
* Make BG image fade in sooner
* Add OpenGraph meta tags to all pages (pulling data programmatically)
* Store all fonts locally
* Somehow reset page top periodically, so the navbar doesn't stick in the wrong places?
	* Or reset when scrolling back to the top?
* Maybe instead of back-to-top button linking to an ID, have it scroll up until the navbar unsticks
* On mobile, close menu after clicking back-to-top button
	* Need to make this execute, *and* still keep scrolling to the top
* Improve buttons in lightbox
* Add dark-mode toggle
* Replace fontawesome icons with SVG code
* Get rid of jQuery
	* Figure out how that "scrolly" thing works to smoothly move between points on the page
* Add comments
	* Or just reaction buttons?
* Introduce a highlight colour, or make tinted instead of plain black?
	* Brownish (like a raccoon)?
	* Or the existing bright blue could be more prminent
* Rebuild gallery in Pico
	* Background images:
		* Same image as the page you're viewing? (Need to use a small size to preserve bandwidth)
		* A blurred rendition of the image (eg. a colour value matrix)?
		* A solid colour, derived somehow from the image?
		* A common background across all pages?
